          I'm Michael Song, a class of 2028 B.S. computer science and biology
          student at Northeastern University. I'm interested in software
          engineering, bioinformatics, and machine learning.

            In the past, I've worked on projects involving web development, data
            analysis, and AI. Currently, I'm a data analyst at Kaerwell and a
            software developer for Sandbox Software Consultancy at Northeastern.
            Outside of class and work, I'm involved with the Society of Asian
            Scientists and Engineers (SASE), rock climb and play volleyball.

          I'm currently looking for research opportunities year-round, co-ops
          for Spring 2026, and internships for Summer 2026. If you have any
          questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
